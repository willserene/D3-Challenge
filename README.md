# D3 Challenge

## About

This project centered on using D3 to create an interactive scatter plot in order to visualize the relationship between particular demographics and major US health risks. The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

The scatter plot is coded in the app.js file, with the data.csv file pulled in using the d3.csv function.
