# D3-Challenge

Using the D3 techniques we learned in class, I created a scatter plot to visualize particular demographics associated with health risks in the data set provided. The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

The scatter plot is coded in the app.js file, with the data.csv file pulled in using the d3.csv function.

*Currently the functionality provides a comparison between Poverty % and Obesity % however the additional variables will be added in future revisions / updates to this repository*
